## BAT-Net: An Enhanced RNA Secondary Structure Prediction via Bidirectional GRU-Based Network with Attention Mechanism

Input: RNAs sequential features are presented in the form of matrix,<br />
In practice, all the codes and results are packing in the form of .zip files to faciliate uploading or downloading. 
       
### Software
To run our program, put the data files and the code files under the same directory.
       
#### Environment
* Python: 3.6
* TensorFlow: 1.4.0
* CPU (multi-core is better)
* memory (more than 4 GB memory is better)
* 64-bit Windows Operating Systems

### Data
* Benchmark dataset is illustrated in [1]. These five datasets contain totally 2493 annotated RNA sequences. These datasets are downloaded from RNA STRAND database website.

### Result
SEN, PPV, ACC, MCC are the outcomes. <br />
Also, we give the case study results.
